# Hagrid
Hagrid is a hybrid RP/Video Game bot developed for discord to 
simulate the Hogwarts experience. It was created in anticipation of the 
Wizards Unite Augmented Reality Mobile Game released in 2019. With Hagrid you start 
your journey in Diagon Alley before being whisked away to Hogwarts where
you'll study and adventure your way from First to Seventh Year. Gain 
experience as you interact with other students, journey through mazes 
and dungeons, fight together to take down ferocious beasts, brew potions, and a whole 
lot more. For more information you can view the wiki [here](https://hagrid.fandom.com/wiki/Hagrid_Wiki).

Hagrid is only designed to be used in the [offical discord server](https://discord.gg/PWKYMct). 
As such, any forks of this repo may require knowledge of programming in order to customize the bot to your discord server.
